          content: 'If we talk about the 2010’s, we have observed a massive growth in modern web and mobile applications, powered by lightweight and sophisticated JavaScript libraries. Better user experience is now derived from the speed of the application and as more customers start using a particular technology, companies have to strive towards scalability. Considering there are a plethora of frameworks to choose from, software teams fall victim to the bothersome “paradox of choice”; that is, the dilemma to decide which one is better than the other before pitching it to upper management. Choosing a framework is a challenging task. It could be viewed as more of a business decision than a technological one if one thinks about it.eact.js is one such Javascript library that has achieved massive popularity within the domain of online, web-based businesses and that too for a perfectly good reason. The one thing that it does exceptionally well — carve out great looking user interfaces (UI). With the principle that HTML and JavaScript are bound to collaborate side-by-side, React was created with a business-forward mindset by leveraging faster web-page load speed, SEO friendliness and code reusability through combining the two technologies.A Very Concise IntroductionReact was developed by Facebook in 2011 and given open-source status in 2013 under the controversial BSD3 license. Since its first release, React’s Github repository has generated 96,000 stars from developers and has amassed a community of almost 1200 active contributors, regularly pushing updates to enrich the library. With over 7M downloads in the month of May alone, this library has definitely proven its preference within technology companies.Which Companies Use ReactBusinesses were quick to grasp this technology because of the simplicity it offered to developers; that is, the ability to learn React in bare minimum time. Code reusability with hassle-free addition/modification of functionalities in the existing system meant allocating significantly less time and budget on development and building larger teams, respectively.Top companies are truly enamored by React’s capabilities on a business stand point. The list of companies utilizing React in production is there to prove it, just to name a few: Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Whatsapp, Salesforce, Uber, The New York Times, CNN, Dropbox, DailyMotion, IMDB, Venmo, and Reddit are the major league ones among the 100+ other medium to large scale companies.To elaborate on why businesses are converging towards this technology, we need to explore React’s primary features that facilitate the creation of high performance, agile applications, then proceed on to the pros and cons associated with using React in online businesses before finally finishing it off with a conclusion.1.0 ReactJS has Power-Packed FeaturesTo give a high-level overview of what React is capable of, we need to understand the core concepts and features associated with the library.
